## About This Project
This Plant Life Monitor (PLM) has been designed to help prevent the avoidable deaths of indoor
household plants. Household plants are not only decorative; they also increase the air quality of their
surrounding environment. There are many different types of plants that can be demanding or expensive.
This makes proper care of these plants essential. For a first-time plant owner or those that are busy or
forgetful, it is very easy for a plant to die from being placed in the wrong environment or from a lack of
attention on the owner's part. The PLM was designed to solve this problem by measuring the plant’s
environment and warning the user if its conditions aren’t ideal. This reduces the user’s effort and
ensures the plant receives proper care.
